## Introduction
This app was created as a personal project. It was made using [ReactJS](reactjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com) as CSS framework.

All data is fetched from [Anilist](anilist.co)'s public API (Application Programming Interface). The API uses the [GraphQL](graphql.org) query language to handle requests as opposed to REST APIs.

 You can learn more about the public API in the [documentation](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/) provided or use their [Interactive GraphQL Editor](https://anilist.co/graphiql).

I made this choice of API because the documentation made things easy to understand and to better familiarize myself with GraphQL queries.

# How to run
The app was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). You can learn more in the documentation.

You can install dependencies by using Node Package Manager NPM. 

Make sure you have Node installed in your system type the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/youssefjj/rakki.git # Clone repository

$ cd rakki # Change working directory

$ npm install # Install dependencies

$ npm start # Run the React app
``` 

# Features
As mentioned previously, Rakki gets all of it's data from the Anilist API, and I've added the ability to select a random anime or manga on the fly. 

The reason that, from my experience , it's always bothersome for me to look for an anime to watch, or select one from my backlog and even that process takes a lot of time üòÖ. 

So I've made Rakki üòä, a simple application with a simple interface, and some easter eggs sprinkled here and there üòâ.
## Randomize Anime/Manga
 Choose a random media (anime or manga) and display major info such as main plot, genres, number of episodes/chapters, tailer, etc... 

May Lady Luck shine on you üçÄ!
